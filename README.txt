StealthMod
###############
This is a stealth game mod, essentially like metal gear solid and a mix of assassins creed with the stealth aspect. You have to sneak and be stealthy to survive the enemies with a few objectives to do mid game. Unlike normal quake there are new items and the weapons are changed. A few metal gear solid weapons are in game as well as a new throwable item, a grenade!!

How to play:
Basically like normal quake, except you can sneak a lot better, and be stealthy. Stealth is key to this mod, as being quieter will make it easier. If you get caught you will have to start over.
New button(s): After you get grenades click "g" to throw grenades.
New Items/Weapons/Features: The machine gun has a thermal scope, The lightning gun is now a flamethrower, and new items include a box (Spawn it in with "spawn vehicle_phatride"), a bandage, and body armor. These are all newest additions to quake4 in this mod.
