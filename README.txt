StealthMod
###############
This is a stealth game mod, essentially like metal gear solid and a mix of assassins creed with the stealth aspect. You have to sneak and be stealthy to survive the enemies with a few objectives to do mid game. Unlike normal quake there are new items and the weapons are changed. A few metal gear solid weapons are in game as well as a new throwable item, a grenade!!

How to play:
Basically like normal quake, except you can sneak a lot better, and be stealthy. Stealth is key to this mod, as being quieter will make it easier. If you get caught you will have to essentially start over.
New button(s): After you get grenades click "g" to throw grenades. After you get napalm ammo click "e" to throw thermite. 
New Items/Weapons/Features: The machine gun has a thermal scope, The lightning gun is now a flamethrower, and new items include a box (Spawn it in with "spawn vehicle_phatride"), a bandage, and body armor. These are all newest additions to quake4 in this mod.
